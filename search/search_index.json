The looks I got were various \u2014 from thoughtful, to questioning, and all the shades in between. Important information that needs to be known: my background is a Ph.D. in computational and theoretical biophysical chemistry. Just to say \u2014 the look thingy really improved since then.</p> <p>So, how I went from this very long exotic titled background to being a technical writer in a software company?</p> <p>I will not hide that I wasn\u2019t looking for this job. I had gone through 1 year of evening classes about Python and Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and so on. But it was not really enough to land me an IT job \u2014 too specialized in chemistry to get an internship in data stuff, not enough knowledge to get a full-time job in data stuff.</p> <p>Until I got my interviews with KNIME. They were very nice and looked deeper into what I could offer them, based on what they needed, and my skills. They were able to see that Ph.D. is a job \u2014 it gives you resilience, ability, and the right set of skills to make the jump out of the Academia, into the magic world outside.</p> <p>The rest is history: they told me \u201cwhat about Technical Writer\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI answered \u201clet me google that\u201d. And then, after reading, among other things, through the most fundamental website that you need to know to become a Technical Writer\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://www.writethedocs.org/\u200a\u2014\u200aI accepted the position.</p> <p>I have been the Technical Writer there since then. I have taken care of the documentation website, release notes, FAQs, UX Writing, talking with support and solution engineers, developers, UX designers, product owners, product managers, and I have to admit: I found my thing.</p> <p>It took me a very long time to write this first Medium story. I don\u2019t know if this is interesting for anyone \u2014 but my other big passion is mentoring \u2014 maybe someone out there will read this and get inspired.</p> <p>The take home message, I guess, is: there is a whole spectrum of jobs that you can do and sometimes the right one is presented to you (I was very lucky!), some other times you need to look for it. The important thing is being prepared and enjoy the journey.</p> <p>P.s. I would like to write the next story about \u201cwhy I left Academia\u201d \u2014 in the meantime you can listen to this: https://youtu.be/LKiBlGDfRU8?si=_0f1b-ye8mUZlXZ6</p>"},{"location":"admonitions/","title":"Admonitions","text":"<p>This is a note</p> <p>Test that this is a non collapsible note</p> This is a info <p>Test that this is a collapsible info</p> <p>This is another info</p> <p>Test that this is a non collapsible info</p>"},{"location":"code-examples/","title":"Code examples","text":"add_numbers.py<pre><code># Function to add two numbers\ndef add_two_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Example usage\nresult = add_two_numbers(5, 3)\nprint('The sum is:', result)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact me","text":"<p>You can contact me through the following channels:</p> <ul> <li>LinkedIn \u200a\u2014 https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariatombolelli1987/</li> <li>Bluesky \u200a\u2014 https://bsky.app/profile/dariat-berlin.bsky.social</li> <li>Github \u200a\u2014 https://github.com/dariaavv</li> </ul> <p>Or you can just send me an e-mail at tombolelli.daria@gmail.com</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/","title":"Index","text":"<p>This is a collection of different articles about technical writing in the software field.</p>"}]}
